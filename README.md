# HTAccessIPBlocker

HTAccessIPBlocker is a Python script that generates `.htaccess` code for blocking a list of IP addresses. This tool can be used to add IP-based access control to your web server by creating rules that deny access to specified IP addresses.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to have Python installed on your system to use this script.

### Usage

1. Create a text file named `ip_list.txt` in the same directory as the script.
2. Add each IP address you want to block on a new line in the `ip_list.txt` file.
3. Run the script using the command:

   ```bash
   python htaccess_ip_blocker.py
